In the present project, we investigate the molecular structure - activity relationship of molecules binding to AMPK alpha 1 sub-unit to discriminate the active from the non-active ones. We developed two classification pipeline using, respectively, an Artificial Neural Network and a Random Forest Classifier. As our models learn in a high-dimensional context, both pipelines were enhanced with a LASSO method to reduce the variable space. Thus, the overfitting risk can be drastically reduced.
